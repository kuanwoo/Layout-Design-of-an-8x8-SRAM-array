# Layout-Design-of-an-8x8-SRAM-array
The project is about building an 8-row by 8-bit SRAM memory array, using 65nm CMOS technology. Using a 3-to-8 decoder, the SRAM array is accessed by a 3-bit address. The SRAM cells are designed to achieve lowest power consumption and suitable static noise margin, while operating at 100 MHz Read &amp; Write cycles. The test-bench, the implementation, and the layout of the SRAM array and the decoder are done using Cadence Virtuosoâ€™s Analog-Design Environment (ADE). Static Noise Margin plots &amp; calculation are obtained through Matlab scripts.
